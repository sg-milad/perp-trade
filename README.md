# ⚖️ Decentralized Perpetuals Protocol

A minimal, modular, and secure decentralized perpetuals trading protocol. Inspired by the elegance of simplicity, this MVP is built to demonstrate the core mechanics behind perpetual derivatives—trustless margin trading, liquidity provisioning, and real-time liquidation.

## 🎯 Goal & Deliverables

This protocol has **2 Missions**. This repository delivers **Mission 1**, which implements roughly **50%** of the basic functionality of a decentralized perpetuals protocol. The smart contract codebase is intentionally compact (\~a few hundred lines), focusing on clarity and correctness.

## 🧠 System Overview

The protocol uses an **oracle-priced pool** model. There is no
order book and no AMM curve: every trade executes at the Chainlink BTC/USD
price, and the USDT Vault funded by liquidity providers pays trader profits
and keeps trader losses plus fees.

### 🔄 User Flow & Interactions

1. **Liquidity Provider** deposits collateral into the vault.
2. **Trader** opens a long/short position by depositing margin and selecting leverage.
3. **Smart Contract** calculates risk, reserves required liquidity, and updates the state.
4. **Liquidator Bot** monitors open positions and liquidates them if margin requirements are not met.
5. **LPs** can withdraw unreserved liquidity at any time.

### 👥 Actors & Roles

* **Trader** – Opens & manages leveraged positions.
* **Liquidity Provider (LP)** – Supplies protocol liquidity for margin trading.
* **Liquidator Bot** – Monitors the chain and enforces liquidation.
* **Admin (you)** – Currently managing upgrades, configurations, and risk parameters.

## 📐 Key Formulas

* **PnL**:
  `PnL = Position Size * (Current Price - Entry Price)`
* **Margin Ratio**:
  `Margin Ratio = Collateral / Position Value`
* **Liquidation Condition**:
  `Margin Ratio < Maintenance Margin`
* **Max Leverage Check**:
  `Used Liquidity ≤ X% of Total Available Liquidity`
