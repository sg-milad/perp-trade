# Decentralized Perpetuals Protocol

---

## Goal & Deliverables

The first mission focuses on implementing roughly 50% of the basic functionality of a decentralized perpetuals protocol. Donâ€™t fretâ€”this initial MVP should remain compact (a few hundred lines of Solidity), not as large as GMX V2â€™s 10,000+ SLOC.

### Must-Have

- **Protocol Name**: Decide on a unique, memorable name for our protocol.
- **Smart Contracts** with corresponding tests for:

  - Liquidity Providers can deposit and withdraw liquidity.
  - A way to fetch the real-time price of the asset being traded.
  - Traders can open a perpetual position for BTC with a given size and collateral.
  - Traders can increase the size of an existing perpetual position.
  - Traders can increase the collateral of a perpetual position.
  - Enforce that traders cannot utilize more than a configured percentage of the deposited liquidity.
  - Prevent liquidity providers from withdrawing liquidity that is reserved for open positions.

### Documentation (README)

- **How does the system work?** Outline user flows and contract interactions.
- **Actors & Roles**: Who are the users? Is there a keeper? Whatâ€™s the admin responsible for?
- **Known Risks & Issues**: Highlight potential pitfalls (e.g., oracle manipulation, insolvency scenarios).
- **Key Formulas**: Any formulas used for funding, margin, P\&L, liquidation, etc.

## ðŸš€ Contributing

Iâ€™m currently building this protocol solo and looking for collaborators! If youâ€™re interested in DeFi, Solidity, and protocol design, letâ€™s work together.

<!-- ## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
